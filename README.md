# Arduino MIDI Controller



Plan:
- [x] Code it
    - [x] Potentiometers
    - [x] Buttons
    - [x] Faders
    - [x] Write the efficient code for more sensors
        - [x] for pots
        - [x] for buttons
    - [x] Add the command switch
        - [x] for pots
        - [x] for buttons
    - [x] Add the LED for the switch
    - [x] Clean the code
- [ ] Construct it
    - [ ] Design an enclosure
    - [ ] More buttons
    - [ ] More stuff
    - [ ] Wiring and soldering
- [x] circuit design w/ Fritzing
- [ ] Tutorial


First project that worked for me:
https://www.instructables.com/id/Easy-3-Pot-Potentiometer-Arduino-Uno-Effects-Midi-/

This one has buttons and fader, didnâ€™t work for me yet:

Made the CC work, had troubles with button, asked a question:

Got the hint at the forum: Pull Up Resistor:

This is a switch example I used to make the button work as I needed:
